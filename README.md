# VaxsPass
### A Hackathon Project
VaxsPass is the outcome of a hackathon. More specifcally [Treehacks by Stanford](http://treehacks.com/). Since it was made in 36 hours, some parts of the app's UI is a bit...how do I say it...unpolished.

VaxsPass uses blockchain to provide proof that a user received a vaccine. When creating an account on our app, the user scans the vaccine card that they received from their vaccination site, which is being verified by Google Cloud Vision API. The data is parsed, anonymized, and stored in our Ethereum smart contract. Then, whenever a user needs to provide proof of vaccination, the app would provide a QR code redirecting to a site where anyone can see a userâ€™s vaccination status.

The app also provides users with a map of nearby locations that can administer the Covid-19 vaccine and a chatbot that can answer user's questions about coronavirus.
